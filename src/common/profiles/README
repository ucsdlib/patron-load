Profiles
--------

Each properties file in this directory corresponds to a server environment, and
contains the info that apps need to find static files, make links, etc.  These
values are substituted for tokens (@clusterHostName@) in web.xml by the Ant
filtering system at build time, so config files for each environment aren't
needed.

    clusterHostName     fully-qualified base URL of the load-balancer (if any)
                        or host (if not).

    clusterSharedPath   full path to the directory that contains static files.
                        this dir should contain subdirs for many applications,
                        and the document root in the htdocs subdir.

    transportGuarantee  CONFIDENTIAL if this environment supports SSL, and NONE
                        if not.

    servers             comma-separated list of tomcat servers in this
                        environment.
